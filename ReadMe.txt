Note to tutor:
	- my code takes a few minutes to run the first epoch, please wait for at least 3-5 mins and it will start running
	- I did not add the load or save command in my program

Files included in submission:
	- MLP.py
	- CNN.py
	- RESNET.py
	- makefile
	- app.py (used in makefile to test if the virtual environment is built)
	
How to run my program:
	- build virtual environment by running the command:
		>> make
		
	- activate the virtual environment by running the command:
		>> source ./venv/bin/activate 

	- deactivate the virtual environment by running the command "deactivate" 

	- to run any of the programs:
		>> python3 MLP.py
		>> python3 CNN.py

		- the program will run until iteration completetion and
		once complete it will prompt the user for an input path.
